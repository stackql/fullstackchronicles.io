motherhood statement (there are plenty of those out there already), but a metaphor about resourcefulness.</p><p>We have all heard the adage “when life gives you lemons, make lemonade”. Allow me to present a slight twist (pardon the pun…) on this statement.</p><p>Cognac is a variety of brandy named after the town of Cognac, France. It is distilled from a white wine grown from grapes in the area. The wine used to make Cognac is characterised as &quot;virtually undrinkable&quot;. However in its distilled form, Cognac is considered to be the world&#x27;s most refined spirit. With bottles of high end Cognac fetching as much as $200,000.</p><p>The area surrounding the town of Cognac was a recognised wine-growing area dating back to the third century, however when it was evident that the grapes produced in the town of Cognac itself were unsuitable for wine making, local producers developed the practice of double distillation in copper pot stills and ageing in oak barrels for at least two years. The product yielded was the spirit we now know as Cognac.</p><p>Fast forward 15 centuries to Scotland in the 1800’s, where John Walker was a humble shopkeeper. Local whiskey producers would bring John different varieties of single malt whiskeys, many of them below an acceptable standard. Instead of on selling these varieties – he began blending them as made-to-order whiskies, blended to meet specific customer requirements. From this idea a product (and subsequently one of the most globally recognised brands) was created which would last over 200 years.</p><p><strong>Interesting, but what does this have to do with technology you might ask?</strong></p><p>Ingenuity and resourcefulness have existed for as long as man has, but in the realm of technology and in particular cloud computing and open source software it has never been more imperative. We are continually faced with challenges on each assignment or project, often technology not working as planned or as advertised, or finding dead ends when trying to solve problems. This is particularly evident now as software and technology are moving at such an accelerated rate.</p><p>To be successful in this era you need creativity and lateral thinking. You need an ability not just to solve problems to which there are no documented solutions, but to create new products from existing ones which are not necessarily suitable for your specific objective. In many cases, looking to add value in the process. That is not just making lemonade from lemons (which anyone could think of) but making Cognac from sub-standard grapes or premium blended whiskey from sub-standard single malt whiskies.</p><p>One of my favourite Amazon Leadership Principles is <strong><em>“Invent and Simplify”</em></strong>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here&quot;. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>https:</strong></em><strong>//www.amazon.jobs/en/principles</strong></a>  </p></blockquote><p>The intent in this statement is not simply to “lift and shift” current on premise systems and processes to the cloud, but to look for ways to streamline, rationalise and simplify processes in doing so. This mandates a combination of practicality and creativity.</p><p>The take away is when you are presented with a challenge, be creative and inventive and not just solve the problem but look for ways to add value in the process.</p><p>Cheers!</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_2ga9 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/cloud">cloud</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/creativity">creativity</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/lateral-thinking">lateral-thinking</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/open-source-software">open-source-software</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/technology">technology</a></li></ul></div><div class="col col--3 text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about When Life Gives you Undrinkable Wine – Make Cognac…" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/when-life-gives-you-undrinkable-wine-make-cognac"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/cost-of-future-change">The Cost of Future Change</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2018-12-08T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">December 8, 2018</time> · 4 min read</div><div class="row margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_1R69"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyaven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img class="image_1yU8" src="https://s.gravatar.com/avatar/f96573d092470c74be233e1dded5376f?s=80" alt="Jeffrey Aven"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyaven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Jeffrey Aven</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Technologist and Cloud Consultant</small></div></div></div></div></header><meta itemprop="image" content="https://cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/images/changes-ahead.jpg"><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor anchor__h3 anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_3R7-" id="what-we-should-really-be-focused-on-but-no-one-is"></a>what we should really be focused on (but no one is…)<a class="hash-link" href="#what-we-should-really-be-focused-on-but-no-one-is" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img alt="Cost of Future Change" src="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/assets/images/changes-ahead-3d37059d33dcbf66b5d0157808722f40.jpg"></p><p>In my thirty year career in Technology I can’t think of a more profound period of change. It is not as if change never existed previously, it did. Innovation and Moore&#x27;s law have been constant features in technology. However, for decades we had experienced a long period of relativity stability. That is, the rate of change was somewhat fixed. This was largely due to the fact that change, for the most part, was dictated almost entirely by a handful of large companies (such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, SAP, etc.). We, the technology community, were exclusively at the mercy of the product management teams at these companies dreaming up the next new feature, and we were subject to the tech giant’s product release cycle as to when we could use this feature. The rate of change was therefore artificially suppressed to a degree.</p><p>Then along came the open source software revolution. I can recall being fortunate enough to be in a meeting with Steve Ballmer along with a small group of Microsoft partners in Sydney, Australia around 2002. I can remember him as a larger than life figure with a booming voice and an intense presence. I can vividly remember him going on a long diatribe about Open Source Software, primarily focused around Linux. To put some historical context around it, Linux was a fringe technology at best at that point in time – nobody was taking it seriously in the enterprise. The Apache Software Foundation wasn’t a blip on the radar at the time, Software-as-a-Service was in its infancy, and Platform-as-a-Service and cloud were non-factors – so what was he worried about?</p><p>From the fear instilled in his rant, you would have thought this was going to be the end of humanity as we knew it. Well it was the beginning of the end, the end of the halcyon days of the software industry as we knew it. The early beginnings of the end of the monopoly on change held by a select few software vendors. The beginning of the democratisation of change.</p><p>Fast forward fifteen years, and now everyone is a (potential) software publisher. Real world problems are solved in real companies and in many cases software products are created, published and made (freely) available to other companies. We have seen countless examples of this pattern, Hadoop at Yahoo!, Kafka at LinkedIn, Airflow at Airbnb, to name a few. Then there are companies created with scant capital or investment, driven by a small group of smart people focused on solving a problem or streamlining a process that they have encountered in the real world. Many of these companies growing to be globally recognised names, such as Atlassian or Hashicorp.</p><p>The rate of change is no longer suppressed to the privileged few – in fact we have an explosion of change. No longer do we have a handful of technology options to achieve a desired outcome or solve a particular problem, we have a constellation of options.</p><p>Now the bad news, the force multiplier in change created by open source communities cuts both ways. When the community is behind a project it gets hyper-charged, conversely when the community drops off, functionality and stability drop off just as quickly.</p><p>This means there are components, projects, modules, services we are using today that won’t be around in the same format in 2-3 years’ time. There are products that don’t exist today that will be integral (and potentially critical) to our operations in 1-2 years’ time.</p><p>This brings me to my final point – the cost of future change. We as leaders and custodians of technology in this period should not only factor in current day run costs or the cost of change we know about (the cost of current change), but the hidden cost of future change. We need to think that whatever we are doing now is not what we will be doing in a years’ time – we will need to accommodate future change.</p><p>We need to be thinking about the cost of future change and what we can do to minimise this. This means not just swapping out one system for another, but thinking about how you will change this system or component again in the near future. We need to take the opportunity that is in front of us to replace monoliths with modular systems, move from tightly coupled to loosely coupled components, from proprietary systems to open systems, from rigid architectures to extensible architectures.</p><p>When you’re planning a change today, consider the cost of future change…</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_2ga9 padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/change">change</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/open-source-software">open-source-software</a></li><li class="tag_11ep"><a class="tag_1Okp tagRegular_3MiF" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags/technology">technology</a></li></ul></div><div class="col col--3 text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about The Cost of Future Change" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/cost-of-future-change"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Blog</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/">Home</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/archive">Archive</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io/tags">Tags</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Sponsors</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://infraql.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>InfraQL<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://gammadata.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>Gamma Data<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/cloudywithachanceofbigdata/cloudywithachanceofbigdata.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item"><span>GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_3J9K"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></span></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"></div></div></footer></div>
